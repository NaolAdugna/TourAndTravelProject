                    Pricing is an essential component of any tourism as it provides visitors with a clear understanding of the costs associated with various activities and services. 
                    Offering package pricing is a great way to bundle different activities and services together at a discounted rate. This can include tours, accommodations, meals, and transportation. Package pricing is an excellent way to provide visitors with value for their money while also encouraging them to experience more of what Ethiopia has to offer.
                    Listing attractions or services as per-person pricing is a straightforward approach that allows visitors to know precisely how much they will spend per person for each activity or service they use.
                    Prices may vary according to seasons or periods of the year. You may provide different rates for peak season and off-peak season based on the number of people and components included in the package.
                    When customers require a unique experience or customized itinerary for their visit, consider an individual quote based on their specific requirements.
                    When pricing tourism experiences, it's best to be transparent and upfront about costs so visitors know what to expect when planning their itineraries. By clearly outlining pricing options, you can help visitors make informed decisions about the experiences and services that fit within their budget.
                    Price methods of a tourism agency typically involve using dynamic pricing algorithms that take into account the demand for seats on flights or the occupancy rates of hotels. This lets them offer competitive prices for customers while still maintaining profits for the agency. Other methods may include mark-ups from vendor prices to cover administrative costs such as website maintenance, customer service or employee wages.</p>
